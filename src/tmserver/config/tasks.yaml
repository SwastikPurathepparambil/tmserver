  research_task:
    description: |
      Analyze the job posting at {job_posting_url}. Extract and clearly label:
      - Required skills (must-have)
      - Preferred skills (nice-to-have)
      - Responsibilities / team context
      - Tech stack (languages, frameworks, tools, cloud/services)
      - Eligibility / constraints (location, timeline, student status)
      - Exact keywords likely used by ATS

      IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES:
      - You MUST return a single JSON object.
      - Do NOT wrap the JSON in backticks.
      - Do NOT include any markdown or commentary, just raw JSON.

      From the provided resume/work-experience text, identify demonstrated skills,
      projects, outcomes, and strongest stories. Map them to the research_task output
      and note any gaps (do not invent). Use the reading tools over resume and
      work-experience content.

  resume_strategy_task:
    description: |
      Produce a single tailored resume using ONLY facts from the candidate materials
      and profile_task, aligned to research_task requirements.

      You are NOT outputting free-form text. You are outputting a structured JSON
      resume that will later be rendered into a PDF.

      SCHEMA (this is VERY IMPORTANT):

      {
        "contact": {
          "name": "Full Name (string)",
          "email": "string or null",
          "phone": "string or null",
          "location": "string or null",
          "links": ["string", "..."]
        },
        "headline": "Short title/headline string tailored to the job",
        "summary": "2–4 sentence professional summary aligned with the job",
        "sections": [
          {
            "title": "Education",
            "items": [
              {

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

      HARD FORMAT RULES:
      - You MUST return EXACTLY ONE JSON object that matches the schema above.
      - The sections MUST include at least these three titles: "Education", "Experience", "Projects".
      - Do NOT include markdown, backticks, or any explanatory text.
      - Use concise, impact-focused bullets under Experience/Projects (1–2 lines each).
      - Naturally include relevant keywords from research_task only if they are true for the candidate.

  resume_workshop_questions_task:
    agent: workshop_facilitator
    description: >
      Using the provided inputs, generate a focused list of reflection questions
      that will help the candidate meaningfully improve their resume.

      You are given:
      - workshop_focus: A short description of what the candidate is aiming for
        (e.g. "software engineering internships", "data roles in fintech").
      - job_posting_url: A URL to a representative job posting (may be empty).
      - personal_writeup: Free-form notes about the candidate's background and goals.
      - Tools:
        - read_resume: to read the candidate's resume text, if available.
        - read_workexp: to read their work-experience notes.
        - scrape_tool / search_tool: to inspect the job posting or related roles.

      Your output must:
      - Ask 7–10 specific, action-oriented questions.
      - Reference concrete parts of their experience when possible.
      - Tie questions back to workshop_focus and/or the job posting.
      - Avoid generic questions like "What are your strengths?" unless customized.

    expected_output: >
